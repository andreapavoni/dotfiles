Contributors are welcome! I'm a big believer in [the GitHub flow](http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/).

Here's the process in a nutshell:

 1. Fork it on GitHub. :fork_and_knife:
 2. Grab a local clone of your fork with your git client of choice and navigate into that directory.
 3. Run `apm link --dev` to symlink your working copy to Atom's "development" packages directory.
 4. Create a branch and work on your awesome bug or feature!
 5. Open a pull request.
 6. Get it merged. Profit :dollar:

Some helpful tips and guidelines:

 * Commit often!
 * Write specs whenever you can! You can run the spec suite with the `Window: Run Package Specs` command, or from the command line by running `apm test`.
 * Give it a spin live by running atom with `atom -d` in a directory with some juicy conflicts.
 * Consider opening a pull request *before* you're done.
 * Follow the style and conventions of existing code.
